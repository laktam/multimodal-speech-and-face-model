# Face and Voice Recognition Project

This project combines image and audio data analysis to make predictions about faces and voices. It utilizes deep learning models to extract face embeddings and audio features, then combines them for classification. The project requires training using set of images and audio files for each person in a group and after training with this set it can recognize each person and classify the others as unknown.

## Features

- Face and audio features extraction.
- Prediction of classes based on an image and an audio file, giving either the exact name or unknown.

## Technologies

- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Librosa
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
