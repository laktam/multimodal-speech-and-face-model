# Face and Voice Recognition Project

This project combines image and audio data analysis to make predictions about faces and voices. It utilizes deep learning models to extract face embeddings and audio features, then combines them for classification.

## Features

- Face extraction from images using HaarCascade.
- Audio feature extraction using MFCC.
- Prediction of classes based on an image and an audio file.

## Technologies

- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Librosa
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
